### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Harshit and I work as a Senior Developer Community Manager with a focus on building and growing MongoDB User Groups across the globe. I have been involved in tech communities for 9+ years now and learned a lot through them. I am generally passionate about tech and keep building smaller tech projects which help me stay productive.

Previously I was working with Topcoder as a Developer Advocate / Developer Evangelist (a competitive programming platform turned crowdsourcing platform) from 2014 to 2021.
